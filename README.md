# Heart-Attack-Risk-Analysis

Overview

This project involves the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset related to heart attack risk factors. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that could help in understanding the factors contributing to heart attacks. The dataset includes various medical parameters and demographic information.

Project Description

The project aims to analyze the factors that might increase the risk of a heart attack using EDA techniques. The analysis is carried out to:

	•	Understand the distribution and central tendencies of variables.
	•	Identify potential correlations between different variables.
	•	Visualize data for better understanding and communication.
	•	Prepare the data for further predictive modeling and analysis.

Dataset Description

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following features:

	•	Age: The age of the patient.
	•	Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).
	•	CP: Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic).
	•	Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
	•	Fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
	•	Exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
	•	Target: 1 or 0 indicating whether the patient has a risk of heart disease.

Installation

To run this analysis, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

EDA Steps

The EDA process follows these steps:

	1.	Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing outliers.
	2.	Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution.
	3.	Data Visualization:
	•	Histograms and boxplots to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
	•	Count plots for categorical variables.
	•	Pair plots and heatmaps to explore correlations between features.
	4.	Correlation Analysis: Identifying and visualizing the correlations between features and the target variable.
	5.	Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve analysis.

Key Findings

Some of the key findings from the EDA include:

	•	Age and Maximum Heart Rate: Older patients tend to have a lower maximum heart rate.
	•	Chest Pain Type: Certain types of chest pain are more strongly associated with heart attack risk.
	•	Exercise-Induced Angina: Patients who experience angina during exercise are at a higher risk of heart attack.
	•	Correlation: Some features like thalach and cp have strong correlations with the target variable.

Conclusion

The EDA has provided significant insights into the factors that may contribute to heart attacks. These findings can inform further predictive modeling or intervention strategies to mitigate heart attack risks.
